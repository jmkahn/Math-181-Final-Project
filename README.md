# Math-181-Final-Project

Welcome to Jenna and Cassidy's final project! 


### Requirements 
Python 3.7.4  
tkinter 8.6

### Instructions
First, make sure `tkinter` (a Python GUI package) is installed on your computer. You can check this by opening Python and typing 
```
>>> import tkinter
```
If you don't see an error message, then `tkinter` is already installed correctly. 

Download `ifs.py`. Open the terminal or command line, navigate to the folder that contains `ifs.py` and type 
```
python ifs.py
``` 
in order to run the file. A window should open that gives you all the further instructions you need. 

We hope you enjoy!
